# Release Process

## Run Integration Tests
Before creating a release EvalML integration tests should be run. Instructions can be found here:
https://github.com/FeatureLabs/evalml-integration-tests

## Documentation
Documentation automatically updates using readthedocs so no need to manually compile.

## Create Release PR
A release PR should have the version number as the title and the changelog updates as the PR body text.
The PR should *merge off master* and include the following:
* Changes to `setup.py` and `evalml/__init__.py` to bump `__version__` to the correct version
* Move changelog items from `Future Releases` into the correct version number
* Confirm that all release items are in the changelog

An example can be found here: https://github.com/FeatureLabs/evalml/pull/163

## Create GitHub Release
After the release pull request has been merged into the master branch, it is time draft the github release.
* The target should be the master branch
* The tag should be the version number with a v prefix (e.g. v0.1.2)
* Release title is the same as the tag
* Release description should be the full changelog updates for the release.

## Release using Release-tools
Run the following assuming you have release-tools installed:
* `flrelease build-package`
* `flrelease upload-package <--url or --license> <install.featurelabs.com or licenses/user.json>`
