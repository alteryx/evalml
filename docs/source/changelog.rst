.. warning::

    **Breaking Changes**

    * The ``fit()`` method for ``AutoClassifier`` and ``AutoRegressor`` has been renamed to ``search()``.
    * ``AutoClassifier`` has been renamed to ``AutoClassificationSearch``
    * ``AutoRegressor`` has been renamed to ``AutoRegressionSearch``
    * ``AutoClassificationSearch.results`` and ``AutoRegressionSearch.results`` now is a dictionary with ``pipeline_results`` and ``search_order`` keys. ``pipeline_results`` can be used to access a dictionary that is identical to the old ``.results`` dictionary. Whereas,``search_order`` returns a list of the search order in terms of pipeline id.
    * Pipelines now require an estimator as the last component in `component_list`. Slicing pipelines now throws an NotImplementedError to avoid returning Pipelines without an estimator.
