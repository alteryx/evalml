    "\n",
    "One of the key choices to make when training an ML model is what metric to choose by which to measure the efficacy of the model at learning the signal. Such metrics are useful for comparing how well the trained models generalize to new similar data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice of metric is a key component of AutoML because it defines the cost function the AutoML search will seek to optimize. In EvalML, these metrics are called **objectives**. AutoML will seek to minimize (or maximize) the objective score as it explores more pipelines and parameters and will use the feedback from scoring pipelines to tune the available hyperparameters and continue the search. Therefore, it is critical to have an objective function that represents how the model will be applied in the intended domain of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML supports a variety of objectives from traditional supervised ML including [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) for regression problems and [cross entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) or [area under the ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) for classification problems. EvalML also allows the user to define a custom objective using their domain expertise, so that AutoML can search for models which provide the most value for the user's problem."
