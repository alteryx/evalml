    "# Understanding Data Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML streamlines the creation and implementation of machine learning models for tabular data. One of the many features it offers is data checks, which are geared towards determining the health of the data before we train a model on it. These data checks have associated actions with them and will be shown in this notebook. In our default data checks, we have the following checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HighlyNullDataCheck: Checks whether the rows or columns are highly null\n",
    "\n",
    "- IDColumnsDataCheck: Checks for columns that could be ID columns\n",
    "\n",
    "- TargetLeakageDataCheck: Checks if any of the input features have high association with the associated targets\n",
    "\n",
    "- InvalidTargetDataCheck: Checks if there are null or other invalid features in the targets\n",
    "\n",
    "- NoVarianceDataCheck: Checks if any targets or features have no variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- NaturalLanguageNaNDataCheck: Checks if any natural language columns have missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "- DateTimeNaNDataCheck: Checks if any datetime columns have missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML has additional data checks that can be seen [here](https://evalml.alteryx.com/en/stable/api_index.html#data-checks), with usage examples [here](https://evalml.alteryx.com/en/stable/user_guide/data_checks.html). Below, we will walk through usage of EvalML's default data checks and actions.\n",
