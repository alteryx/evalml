    "# Understanding Data Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML streamlines the creation and implementation of machine learning models for tabular data. One of the many features it offers is [data checks](https://evalml.alteryx.com/en/stable/user_guide/data_checks.html), which are geared towards determining the health of the data before we train a model on it. These data checks have associated actions with them and will be shown in this notebook. In our default data checks, we have the following checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HighlyNullDataCheck`: Checks whether the rows or columns are highly null\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IDColumnsDataCheck`: Checks for columns that could be ID columns\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TargetLeakageDataCheck`: Checks if any of the input features have high association with the targets\n",
    "\n",
    "- `InvalidTargetDataCheck`: Checks if there are null or other invalid values in the target\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NoVarianceDataCheck`: Checks if either the target or any features have no variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NaturalLanguageNaNDataCheck`: Checks if any natural language columns have missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DateTimeNaNDataCheck`: Checks if any datetime columns have missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML has additional data checks that can be seen [here](https://evalml.alteryx.com/en/stable/api_index.html#data-checks), with usage examples [here](https://evalml.alteryx.com/en/stable/user_guide/data_checks.html). Below, we will walk through usage of EvalML's default data checks and actions.\n",
