    "\n",
    "A time series is a series of measurements taken at different moments in time ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)). The main difference between a time series dataset and a normal dataset is that the rows of a time series dataset are ordered chronologically, where the relative time between rows is significant. This relationship between the rows does not exist in non-time series datasets. In a non-time-series dataset, you can shuffle the rows and the dataset still has the same meaning. If you shuffle the rows of a time series dataset, the relationship between the rows is completely different!\n",

    "## What does AutoMLSearch for time series do?\n",
