    "\n",
    "A time series is a series of measurements taken at different moments in time ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)). The main difference between a time series dataset and a normal dataset is that the rows of a time series dataset are ordered chronologically, where the relative time between rows is significant. This relationship between the rows does not exist in non-time series datasets. In a non-time-series dataset, you can shuffle the rows and the dataset still has the same meaning. If you shuffle the rows of a time series dataset, the relationship between the rows is completely different!\n",

    "## What does AutoMLSearch for time series do?\n",
    "In a machine learning setting, we are usually interested in using past values of the time series to predict future values. That is what EvalML's time series functionality is built to do. "

However, if we had to predict the weather for next Monday-Sunday with the data as it was on the previous Friday, the gap would be 2 (Saturday and Sunday separate Monday from Friday).

    "However, there are some features corresponding to dates in the future that can be known with certainty, either because they can be derived from the forecast date or because the feature can be controlled by the modeler. This includes features such as if the date is a US Holiday, or the location of a store in a sales dataset. With these sorts of features, we don't need to include them in our time-series specific preprocessing steps (such as Time Series Featurization).\n",
