    "EvalML component graphs represent and describe the flow of data in a collection of related components. A component graph is comprised of nodes representing components, and edges between pairs of nodes representing where the inputs and outputs of each component should go. It is the backbone of the features offered by the EvalML [pipeline](pipelines.ipynb), but is also a powerful data structure on its own. EvalML currently supports component graphs as linear and [directed acyclic graphs (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)."

    "## Defining a Component Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Component graphs can be defined by specifying the dictionary of components and edges that describe the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dictionary, each key is a reference name for a component. Each corresponding value is a list, where the first element is the component itself, and the remaining elements are the input edges that should be connected to that component. The component as listed in the value can either be the component object itself or its string name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stucture is very similar to that of [Dask computation graphs](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spec.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the code example below, we have a simple component graph made up of two components: an Imputer and a Random Forest Classifer. The names used to reference these two components are given by the keys, \"My Imputer\" and \"RF Classifier\" respectively. Each value in the dictionary is a list where the first element is the component corresponding to the component name, and the remaining elements are the inputs, e.g. \"My Imputer\" represents an Imputer component which has inputs \"X\" (the original features matrix) and \"y\" (the original target).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature edges are specified as `\"X\"` or `\"{component_name}.x\"`. For example, `{\"My Component\": [MyComponent, \"Imputer.x\", ...]}` indicates that we should use the feature output of the `Imputer` as as part of the feature input for MyComponent. Similarly, target edges are specified as `\"y\"` or `\"{component_name}.y\". {\"My Component\": [MyComponent, \"Target Imputer.y\", ...]}` indicates that we should use the target output of the `Target Imputer` as a target input for MyComponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component can have a number of feature inputs, but can only have one target input. All input edges must be explicitly defined."
