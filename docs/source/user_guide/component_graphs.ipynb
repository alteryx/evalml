    "EvalML component graphs represent and describe the flow of data in a collection of related components. A component graph is comprised of nodes representing components, and edges between pairs of nodes representing where the inputs and outputs of each component should go. It is the backbone of the features offered by the EvalML [pipeline](pipelines.ipynb), but is also a powerful data structure on its own. EvalML currently supports component graphs as linear and directed acyclic graphs (DAG)."

In this dictionary, each key is the name that should be used to reference a component by, and each corresponding value is a list where the first element is the component or component name, and the remaining elements are the input edges that should be connected to that component.\n",

The names used to reference these two components are given by the keys, \"My Imputer\" and \"RF Classifier\" respectively. Each value in the dictionary is a list where the first element is the component corresponding to the component name, and the remaining elements are the inputs, e.g. \"My Imputer\" represents an Imputer component which has inputs \"X\" (the original features matrix) and \"y\" (the original target).\n",
