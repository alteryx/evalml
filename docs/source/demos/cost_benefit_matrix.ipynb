    "[Confusion matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) are tables that summarize the number of correct and incorrectly-classified predictions, broken down by each class. They allow us to quickly understand the performance of a classification model and where the model gets \"confused\" when it is making predictions. For the binary classification problem, there are four possible combinations of prediction and actual target values possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "- true positives (correct positive assignments)\n",
    "- true negatives (correct negative assignments)\n",
    "- false positives (incorrect positive assignments)\n",

    "Although the confusion matrix is an incredibly useful visual for understanding our model, each prediction that is correctly or incorrectly classified is treated equally. For example, for detecting breast cancer, the confusion matrix  does not take into consideration that it could be much more costly to incorrectly classify a malignant tumor as benign than it is to incorrectly classify a benign tumor as malignant. This is where the cost-benefit matrix shines: it uses the cost of each of the four possible outcomes to weigh each outcome differently. By scoring using the cost-benefit matrix, we can measure the score of the model by a concrete unit that is more closely related to the goal of the model. In the below example, we will show how the cost-benefit matrix objective can be used, and how it can give us better real-world impact when compared to using other standard machine learning objectives."
