    "# Custom Objective Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the objective function is very specific to the use-case or business problem. To get the right objective to optimize requires thinking through the decisions or actions that will be taken using the model and assigning the a cost/benifiet to doing that correctly or incorrectly based on known outcomes in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have determined the objective for your business, you can provide that to EvalML to optimize by defining a custom objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Create a Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom objective function, we must define 2 functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **\"objective function\"\"**: this function takes the predictions, true labels, and any other information about the future and returns a score of how well the model performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **\"decision function\"**: this function takes prediction probabilities that were outputted from the model and a threshold and returns a prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a particular model, EvalML automatically finds the best threshold to pass to the decision function to generate predictions and then scores the resulting predictions using the objective function. The score from the objective function determines which set of pipeline hyperparameters EvalML will try next.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a concrete example, let's look at how the fraud detection objective function is built."
