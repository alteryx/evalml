    "# Install\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML is available for Python 3.8 with experimental support 3.9. It can be installed with pip or conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Series support with Facebook's Prophet \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the `Prophet` time series estimator, be sure to install it as an extra requirement. Please note that this may take a few minutes.\n",
    "Prophet is currently only supported via pip installation in EvalML for Mac with CmdStan as a backend.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install evalml[prophet]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another option for installing Prophet with CmdStan as a backend is to use `make installdeps-prophet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In order to do this, you must have the EvalML repo cloned and you must be in the top level folder `<your_directory>/evalml/` to execute this command.\n",
    "This command will do the following:\n",
    "- Pip install `cmdstanpy==0.9.68`\n",
    "- Execute the `install_cmdstan.py` script found within your `site-packages/cmdstanpy` which builds `cmdstan` in your `site-packages`.\n",
    "- Install `Prophet==1.0.1` with the `CMDSTAN` and `STAN_BACKEND` environment variables set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `site-packages` path is incorrect or you'd like to specify a different one, just run `make installdeps-prophet SITE_PACKAGES_DIR=\"<path_to_your_site_packages>\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to have more fine-tuned control over the installation steps for Prophet, such as specifying the backend, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "For CmdStanPy as a backend:\n",
    "1. `pip install cmdstanpy==0.9.68`\n",
    "2. `python <path_to_installed_cmdstanpy>/install_cmdstan.py --dir <path_to_build_cmdstan> -v <version_to_use>`\n",
    "3. `CMDSTAN=<path_to_build_cmdstan>/cmdstan-<version_to_use> STAN_BACKEND=CMDSTANPY pip install prophet==1.0.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "For PyStan as a backend (PyStan is used by default):\n",
    "1. `pip install prophet==1.0.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip with all dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To install evalml with pip, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install evalml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip with core dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML includes several optional dependencies. The `xgboost` and `catboost` packages support pipelines built around those modeling libraries. The `plotly` and `ipywidgets` packages support plotting functionality in automl searches. These dependencies are recommended, and are included with EvalML by default but are not required in order to install and use EvalML.\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalML's core dependencies are listed in `core-requirements.txt` in the source code, and optional requirements are isted in `requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install EvalML with only the core required dependencies, download the EvalML source [from pypi](https://pypi.org/project/evalml/#files) to access the requirements files. Then run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install evalml --no-dependencies\n",
    "pip install -r core-requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add-ons\n",
    "You can install add-ons individually or all at once by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install evalml[complete]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Support** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Add time series support with Facebook's Prophet\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install evalml[prophet]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please note that this may take a few minutes. Prophet is currently only supported via pip installation in EvalML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update checker** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Receive automatic notifications of new EvalML releases\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install evalml[update_checker]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda with all dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To install evalml with conda run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge evalml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda with core dependencies \n",
    "\n",
    "To install evalml with only core dependencies run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge evalml-core\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you are using `pip` to install EvalML, it is recommended you first install the following packages using conda:\n",
    "* `numba` (needed for `shap` and prediction explanations). Install with `conda install -c conda-forge numba`\n",
    "* `graphviz` if you're using EvalML's plotting utilities. Install with `conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz`\n",
    "\n",
    "The [XGBoost](https://pypi.org/project/xgboost/) library may not be pip-installable in some Windows environments. If you are encountering installation issues, please try installing XGBoost from [Github](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html) before installing EvalML or install evalml with conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run on Mac, [LightGBM](https://pypi.org/project/lightgbm/) requires the `OpenMP` library to be installed, which can be done with [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) by running \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install libomp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, `graphviz` can be installed by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install graphviz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python 3.9 support\n",
    "\n",
    "Evalml can still be installed with pip in python 3.9 but note that `sktime`, one of our dependencies, will not be installed because that library does not yet support python 3.9. This means the ``PolynomialDetrending`` component will not be usable in python 3.9. You can try to install `sktime` [from source](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/installation.html#building-from-source) in python 3.9 to use the ``PolynomialDetrending`` component but be warned that we only test it in python 3.8."
