    """Removes trends and seasonality from time series by fitting a polynomial and moving average to the data.

    Scikit-learn's PolynomialForecaster is used to generate the additive trend portion of the target data. A polynomial
        will be fit to the data during fit.  That additive polynomial trend will be removed during fit so that statsmodel's
        seasonal_decompose can determine the addititve seasonality of the data by using rolling averages over the series'
        inferred periodicity.

        For example, daily time series data will generate rolling averages over the first week of data, normalize
        out the mean and return those 7 averages repeated over the entire length of the given series.  Those seven
        averages, repeated as many times as necessary to match the length of the given target data, will be used
        as the seasonal signal of the data.

    Args:
        time_index (str): Specifies the name of the column in X that provides the datetime objects. Defaults to None.
        degree (int): Degree for the polynomial. If 1, linear model is fit to the data.
            If 2, quadratic model is fit, etc. Defaults to 1.
        period (int): The number of entries in the time series data that corresponds to one period of a
            cyclic signal.  For instance, if data is known to possess a weekly seasonal signal, and if the data
            is daily data, period should be 7.  For daily data with a yearly seasonal signal, period
            should be 365.  Defaults to -1, which uses the statsmodels libarary's freq_to_period function.
            https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/main/statsmodels/tsa/tsatools.py
        random_seed (int): Seed for the random number generator. Defaults to 0.
