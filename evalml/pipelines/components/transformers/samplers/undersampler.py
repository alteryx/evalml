            sampling_ratio (float): The smallest minority:majority ratio that is accepted as 'balanced'. For instance, a 1:4 ratio would be
                represented as 0.25, while a 1:1 ratio is 1.0. Must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. Defaults to 0.25.
            min_samples (int): The minimum number of samples that we must have for any class, pre or post sampling. If a class must be downsampled, it will not be downsampled past this value.
                To determine severe imbalance, the minority class must occur less often than this and must have a class ratio below min_percentage.
                Must be greater than 0. Defaults to 100.
            min_percentage (float): The minimum percentage of the minimum class to total dataset that we tolerate, as long as it is above min_samples.
                If min_percentage and min_samples are not met, treat this as severely imbalanced, and we will not resample the data.
                Must be between 0 and 0.5, inclusive. Defaults to 0.1.
            random_seed (int): The seed to use for random sampling. Defaults to 0.
