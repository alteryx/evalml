    """Selects top features based on importance weights using a Random Forest classifier.

    Args:
        number_features (int): The maximum number of features to select.
            If both percent_features and number_features are specified, take the greater number of features. Defaults to None.
        n_estimators (int): The number of trees in the forest. Defaults to 10.
        max_depth (int): Maximum tree depth for base learners. Defaults to None.
        percent_features (float): Percentage of features to use.
            If both percent_features and number_features are specified, take the greater number of features. Defaults to 0.5.
        threshold (string or float): The threshold value to use for feature selection.
            Features whose importance is greater or equal are kept while the others are discarded.
            If "median", then the threshold value is the median of the feature importances.
            A scaling factor (e.g., "1.25*mean") may also be used. Defaults to median.
        n_jobs (int or None): Number of jobs to run in parallel. -1 uses all processes. Defaults to -1.
        random_seed (int): Seed for the random number generator. Defaults to 0.
