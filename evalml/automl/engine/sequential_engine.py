    In order to separate the engine from the AutoMLSearch loop, we need the sequential computations to behave the same
    way as concurrent computations from AutoMLSearch's point-of-view. One way to do this is by delaying the computation
    in the sequential engine until get_result is called. Since AutoMLSearch will call get_result only when the
    computation is "done", by always returning True in done() we make sure that get_result is called in the order that
    the jobs are submitted. So the computations happen sequentially!
